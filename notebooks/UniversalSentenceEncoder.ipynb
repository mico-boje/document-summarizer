      " ROME — Defying reports that their planned partnership is doomed to fail, France’s Naval Group and Italy’s Fincantieri have announced a joint venture to build and export naval vessels. The firms also plan to jointly bid next year on work for midlife upgrades for Horizon frigates, which were built by France and Italy and are in service with both navies. When asked about an initial product to be tackled under the alliance, Guillou acknowledged: “The answer is simple: there is nothing yet.” However, the firms said they are working toward a deal to build four logistics support ships for the French Navy, which will be based on an Italian design. But the firms were optimistic the deal would be “a great opportunity for both groups and their eco-systems, by enhancing their ability to better serve the Italian and French navies, to capture new export contracts, to increase research funding and, ultimately, improve the competitiveness of both French and Italian naval sectors.” Sebastian Sprenger in Paris contributed to this report. The statement called the joint venture the “first steps” toward the creation of an alliance that would create “a more efficient and competitive European shipbuilding industry.” Naval Group CEO Hervé Guillou, speaking at the Euronaval trade expo in Paris on Oct. 24, said the alliance is based on “two countries sharing a veritable naval ambition.” The joint venture is necessary because the “context of the global market has changed drastically,” he added, specifically mentioning new market entrants Russia, China, Singapore, Ukraine, India and Turkey.Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox.By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.
