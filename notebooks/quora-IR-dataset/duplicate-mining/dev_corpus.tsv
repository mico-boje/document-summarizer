The screen shot includes a portion which reads, "Other Names" below which is a name, below which are the words, "Visible Only To You" below which are "Google Contact Details" below which appear again, Visible Only To You." The screen shot was then printed and presented to a third party as evidence of my so-called "other name." I logged in and saw the name, this time with the privacy settings set to Public but this profile defaults to "only you" so it had been changed. These changes to my profile were not made by me. Does the screenshot that was taken then printed mean the party taking it was actually logged in as me. Or is there another explanation?
